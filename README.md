# Plant Disease Detection - MLOps Project üå±

A machine learning project for detecting plant diseases using CNN with complete MLOps pipeline implementation.

## What We Built

- **ML Model**: CNN model to detect plant diseases (Tomato Bacterial Spot, Potato Early Blight, Corn Common Rust)
- **Web App**: Streamlit interface for image upload and prediction
- **Docker Container**: Fully containerized application
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and deployment using GitHub Actions
- **Model Versioning**: DVC integration for model tracking

## Quick Start - Run with Docker

### Pull and Run the Container
```bash
# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull venom1510/plant-disease-detector:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 venom1510/plant-disease-detector:latest

# Open browser: http://localhost:8501
```

### Run in Background
```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name plant-disease-app venom1510/plant-disease-detector:latest

# To stop later
docker stop plant-disease-app
docker rm plant-disease-app
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/venom1510/mlops_project.git
cd mlops_project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
streamlit run main_app.py
```

## What We Implemented

### 1. Docker Containerization
- Optimized Dockerfile with Python 3.9 slim base
- System dependencies for TensorFlow and OpenCV
- Proper layer caching for faster builds
- Health checks and proper port exposure

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- Docker Hub integration for image publishing
- AWS S3 integration for model artifacts via DVC
- Automated testing and deployment on push to main

### 3. MLOps Practices
- Model versioning with DVC
- Containerized ML application
- Automated model deployment
- Cloud storage for model artifacts

## Key Files

- **`main_app.py`**: Streamlit web interface for disease prediction
- **`Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with model training code
- **`plant_disease_model.h5`**: Pre-trained CNN model weights
- **`Dockerfile`**: Container configuration with optimized builds
- **`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies with specific versions

## Dependencies
```
# Core ML Libraries
tensorflow==2.12.0
keras==2.12.0
numpy==1.23.5
opencv-python-headless==4.7.0.72
pillow==9.5.0

# Web UI
streamlit==1.25.0

# Utility libraries
pandas==1.5.3

# Additional dependencies for stability
protobuf==3.20.3
grpcio==1.54.2
```

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: User uploads plant leaf image (JPG format)
2. **Preprocess**: Image resized to 256x256 pixels using OpenCV
3. **Predict**: CNN model classifies the disease type
4. **Display**: Results shown with plant type and disease name

## MLOps Pipeline Flow

1. **Development**: Code changes pushed to GitHub
2. **CI/CD Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow starts automatically
3. **Build**: Docker image built with optimized layers
4. **Test**: Automated testing (if configured)
5. **Deploy**: Image pushed to Docker Hub
6. **Model Sync**: DVC pulls latest model from S3

## Team Notes

- Docker image is automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub on every commit to main
- Model artifacts are stored in AWS S3 and tracked with DVC
- The app is production-ready and can be deployed anywhere Docker runs
- CI/CD pipeline handles all the build complexity automatically
- Image is available at: `venom1510/plant-disease-detector:latest`

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues
```bash
# If Docker pull fails - login first
docker login

# If port 8501 is busy - use different port
docker run -p 8502:8501 venom1510/plant-disease-detector:latest

# Check if container is running
docker ps
```

### Local Development Issues
```bash
# If model file is missing
dvc pull plant_disease_model.h5

# If dependencies fail to install
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

### CI/CD Issues
- Check GitHub secrets are properly configured
- Verify Docker Hub Personal Access Token has correct permissions
- Ensure AWS credentials are valid for DVC integration
